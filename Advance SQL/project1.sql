		- PK(Room_No,Hotel_No)
        - There is no partial dependency
        - There is no transitive dependency. 
        - Suppose if there is only one hotel then room_no->type->price transitive dependency or
			same type of room having same price in differen hotels can also lead transitive dependency.
            But here I am considering different hotels having different location and different prices of rooms according
            to affordability of locality.
